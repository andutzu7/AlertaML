## File disclosure attack
- Crawl the website
- Extract the generated logs
- Create a graph of the website from the logs
- Each time a file gets requested perform a search in the graph to see if the request is valid
## Malware injection
- Extracted all the payloads from the logs
- Sorted the payloads alphabetically
- Tried comparing the found payloads with a shellcode database. Poblems: big execution time because there are too many possible shellcodes to test against (attacks meant for different architectures/platforms/OS's)
## DDOS
- Generating a dataset for the learning/data mining part
----- MALICIOUS TRAFFIC ----
- Performed reconnaisance attacks using nikto (Tuning 6) and gobuster. The traffic came from 2 virtual machines and it was routed throught Tor for IP spoofing
- Performed DDOS(flooding and slowloris) (again, proxy-ing the IP's)
- The attacks were launched simultaneously for creating more randomness in the logs
----- NORMAL TRAFFIC -----
- Clearing and filtering irregular logs from my server
- TODO: Try to group them
